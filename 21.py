# for loops in python 

# why??


# for loop is used in lists 

students=['lohit', 25,'python-developer','Sei', 25,'django-student']

print(students)

print(students[1])

# syntax

# for value in iterable:
#     pass  

for student in students:
    # print(student)
    
    print('ok, result',student)
    
print('---------------------------')
